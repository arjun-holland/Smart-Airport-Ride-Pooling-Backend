# 🧮 DSA Approach & Complexity Analysis

## Ride Matching Algorithm
```
The system uses a Greedy Selection Algorithm to assign an incoming ride to the most optimal active pool.
```
For each incoming ride request:
1. Fetch Candidate Pools : Get all ACTIVE RidePools.
2. Capacity Validation
    - For each pool:
        - Check seat availability
        - Check luggage availability
    - If insufficient → skip pool.
3. Compute Incremental Route Cost
    - For eligible pools:
         - Identify last drop-off location in the pool.
         - Compute:
             ```
               pickupDetour = distance(lastDropOff → newRideSource)
               rideDistance = distance(newRideSource → newRideDestination)
               incrementalCost = pickupDetour + rideDistance
             ```
         - Distance is calculated using the `Haversine formula`.
         - This represents: The additional distance the cab must travel if this ride joins the pool
4. Enforce Detour Constraint
   If incrementalCost > ride.detourToleranceKm
   - Skip the pool.
   - This ensures passenger satisfaction constraints are respected.
5. Greedy Selection
   - Among all valid pools  -->  Select the pool with --> minimum incrementalCost
   - This minimizes total travel deviation.
6. If No Suitable Pool
   - If no pool satisfies:
        - Capacity
        - Detour tolerance
   - Create a new RidePool and assign an available Cab.

### 💡 Why This Is a Greedy Algorithm

Because at each ride arrival:
- We choose the pool with the locally minimal incremental distance.
- We do not recompute global optimal routes.
- No backtracking.
- No dynamic programming.
It is: Greedy, locally optimal selection per request.

### Time Complexity

Let:
- **P** = number of ACTIVE pools
- **K** = Riders per pool

For each incoming ride:
1. Scan all active pools → O(P)
2. For each pool:
   - Capacity check → O(1)
   - Last member lookup → O(1)
   - Distance calculations → O(1)
   Total:O(P)
3. If full member tolerance checks are added (checking all K members): O(P × K)

## Entity Relationships
### Relationship Summary

- Cab (1) → (0..1) RidePool
     - A cab can have at most one active pool at a time.
     - A cab may also be free (no active pool).
- RidePool (1) → (1) Cab
     - Every ride pool must be associated with exactly one cab.
- RidePool (1) → (*) RideRequest
     - A pool can contain multiple ride requests (multiple passengers).
- RideRequest (0..1) → (1) RidePool
     - A ride request may:
         - Not be assigned yet (PENDING)
         - Or belong to exactly one pool (MATCHED)

---

### MongoDB Reference Mapping

- This directly reflects the actual schema implementation:
- RideRequest.poolId → RidePool._id
- RidePool.cabId → Cab._id
- Cab.currentPoolId → RidePool._id
- RidePool.members[] → RideRequest._id[]

This ensures referential clarity while keeping collections decoupled.

---

## Design Patterns Used
### 1️⃣ Service Layer Pattern

- Structure: `Controller → Service → Model`
- Controllers handle HTTP request/response.
- Services contain business logic:
   - Ride matching
   - Pricing calculation
   - Detour validation
   - Cancellation logic
- Models strictly define schema and persistence.

### 2️⃣ Transactional Pattern (MongoDB Sessions)
- MongoDB transactions are used for atomic updates across:
  - RideRequest
  - RidePool
  - Cab
- All related operations (ride status update, pool member update, cab availability update) are executed within a single MongoDB session transaction.

#### Why Transactions Are Required
- Prevents partial writes (e.g., ride marked MATCHED but pool not updated).
- Ensures data consistency across multiple collections.
- Guarantees all-or-nothing execution — either every update succeeds, or all changes are rolled back.

### 3️⃣ Distributed Locking Pattern (Redis - Upstash)

To prevent concurrent modifications of the same RidePool, a distributed lock is acquired using `Upstash Redis` before any pool update.

`
const lock = await redis.set(lockKey, "locked", "EX", 5, "NX");
`

Lock Configuration:
- NX → Set the key only if it does not already exist
- EX 5 → Automatically expire the lock after 5 seconds
- lockKey = lock:pool:<poolId>

#### Prevents Race Condition:

Without locking:
   - Two requests read same pool
   - Both see capacity
   - Both insert
   - Pool overbooks
- Redis ensures only one modification per pool at a time.
- Concurrency safety demonstrated under load testing.

### 4️⃣ Layered Architecture

- Controller → Service → Model -> Models (Mongoose)
- Clear separation of concerns

### Stateless API Design

- No session stored in memory.
- Every request is independent.
- Enables horizontal scaling.
- Safe behind load balancers.

---

### Dynamic Pricing Formula Design

Each ride price is calculated using a distance-based model with pooling incentives.
Formula : 

```
RawPrice =  BaseFare 
            + (BaseDistanceKm × PerKmRate) 
            + (DetourKm × DetourPenaltyRate)

poolingDiscountFactor = 1 - 0.1 * (poolSize - 1);
DiscountFactor = max(poolingDiscountFactor, 0.7)

FinalPrice = RawPrice × DiscountFactor
```

- BaseFare : A fixed minimum charge applied to every ride.
- BaseDistanceKm : The actual direct distance from source to destination.
- PerKmRate : Cost charged per kilometer of direct travel.
- DetourKm : Extra distance added due to pooling.
- DetourPenaltyRate : Rate applied to detour kilometers.
- RawPrice : This is the full cost before applying pooling discount.
- poolSize : Number of passengers in the pool after assignment.
- poolingDiscountFactor : Each additional rider gives 10% discount.
- FinalPrice : FinalPrice is calculated per RideRequest.

Multiplier = 0.7 means: (7/10 ==> 10/100) You pay `70 %` of RawPrice, Which equals: `30 %` discount

| Pool Size | poolingDiscountFactor Formula | DiscountFactor (After Cap) | Discount %   | Final Price Calculation | Final Price |
| --------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 1 - 0.1 × (1 - 1) = 1.0       | max(1.0, 0.7) = 1.0        | 0%           | 160 × 1.0               | **160**     |
| 2         | 1 - 0.1 × (2 - 1) = 0.9       | max(0.9, 0.7) = 0.9        | 10%          | 160 × 0.9               | **144**     |
| 3         | 1 - 0.1 × (3 - 1) = 0.8       | max(0.8, 0.7) = 0.8        | 20%          | 160 × 0.8               | **128**     |
| 4         | 1 - 0.1 × (4 - 1) = 0.7       | max(0.7, 0.7) = 0.7        | 30%          | 160 × 0.7               | **112**     |
| 5         | 1 - 0.1 × (5 - 1) = 0.6       | max(0.6, 0.7) = 0.7        | 30% (capped) | 160 × 0.7               | **112**     |

In pool size 2, each rider pays 144, not split the price among riders.
